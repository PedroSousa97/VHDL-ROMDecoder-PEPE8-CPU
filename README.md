## Project Scope

This project was developed for the Computer Architecture Discipline of University of Madeira, Computer Engineering Course.

The main goal was to develop a simple motherboard with the architecture shown in the above image, using VHDL on the ISE Design Suite Software. The processor was then tested using the integrated software simulator and also using an FPGA. For different inputs the processor performed different operations/outcomes, and the flowchart and simulation results can be found below along this Readme file.

I also built a C++ Assembler from scratch to automatically generate the machine code that was later inserted in the Instruction Memory. That Assembler can be found in the following Repo: https://github.com/PedroSousa97/C-Assembler
